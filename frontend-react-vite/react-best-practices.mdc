- Use functional components and hooks for state management
- Use TypeScript for type checking
- Structure components for reusability and maintainability
- When exporting components from files prefer to use named exports instead of default exports (so `export function App() {}` instead of `export default App`).
- When adding multiple class names, having conditional statements inside the class strings, etc., use the `cn` utility from `@/ui/utils/cn.ts`
