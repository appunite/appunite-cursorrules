# No Re-exports Rule

## Overview
Avoid creating index.ts files that re-export from other modules. Use direct imports instead.

## Why
- Re-export files create unnecessary indirection
- Direct imports are clearer about dependencies
- Easier to track where code comes from
- Reduces bundle size and complexity

## What to do instead
```typescript
// ❌ Don't create index.ts files like this:
// src/api/index.ts
export { getHealthCheck } from './functions'
export { get } from './client'

// ❌ Don't import from index files:
import { getHealthCheck } from './api'

// ✅ Use direct imports:
import { getHealthCheck } from './api/functions'
import { get } from './api/client'
```

## Exceptions
- Only create index.ts for actual barrel exports when absolutely necessary
- Library entry points are acceptable
- Main application entry points (main.tsx, App.tsx) are acceptable
