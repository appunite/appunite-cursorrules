- Don't overly comment code, use comments only in non-standard situations
- Split large components or functions into smaller ones
- Split the code into different logic domains, like `auth`, `ui`, `dataDirectory`, etc.
- Prefer functional over object-oriented approach
- Don't re-export values from files in directories with `index.ts` files, just import things directly
