# Tailwind CSS Best Practices

## Always Use Tailwind CSS Instead of Standard CSS

- **Prefer Tailwind utility classes** over custom CSS whenever possible
- **Use Tailwind's design system** for consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- **Avoid writing custom CSS** unless absolutely necessary for complex animations or third-party integrations
- **Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes** (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:, 2xl:) for responsive design
- **Leverage Tailwind's state variants** (hover:, focus:, active:, disabled:) for interactive states
- **Use Tailwind's dark mode** (dark:) for theme switching
- **Prefer Tailwind's color palette** over custom hex colors
- **Use Tailwind's spacing scale** (p-4, m-2, space-x-4, etc.) for consistent layouts
- **Utilize Tailwind's typography plugin** for rich text content when needed
- **Use Tailwind's component extraction** (@apply) sparingly and only for repeated patterns

## When Custom CSS is Acceptable

- Complex animations that can't be achieved with Tailwind utilities
- Third-party component library overrides
- CSS Grid layouts that require specific grid template areas
- Custom properties (CSS variables) for dynamic theming
- Browser-specific hacks or workarounds

## File Organization

- Keep all Tailwind directives in `src/index.css`
- Avoid creating separate CSS files for components
- Use CSS modules only when absolutely necessary for scoped styles
- Prefer Tailwind's utility-first approach over component-based CSS

## Performance Considerations

- Tailwind's purging will automatically remove unused styles
- Use Tailwind's JIT mode for optimal build performance
- Avoid using arbitrary values unless necessary
- Prefer Tailwind's built-in utilities over custom CSS for better tree-shaking
